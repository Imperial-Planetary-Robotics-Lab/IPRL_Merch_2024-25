# FAQ
Here are the frequently asked questions in our server, please read this first before asking us a question!

## What is Robotics Society?
Robotics society is a society/makerspace running on EE505 with members full of beginner, novice, and advanced robotics (and other fields!) enthusiasts.

## What do I get by joining ICRS?
Well, there's a lot to list, but the basic stuff are:
- Infinite 3D printing! We supply PLA for you all so no need to buy filaments either.
- Access to laser cutter! If you want to use it, ask the committee
- Access to resin printer (basically a 3D printer for something extremely small and detailed)! If you want to use it, also ask the committee.
- Access to soldering and power equipment
- Access to various basic electronics components (resistors, capacitors, fasteners, sensors etc.)
- Many events, especially the beginner 101 courses and novice 102 courses
- Year run projects, led by @Ryusei for IPRL and @Martin for SSL, (dm them for more info!)

## When are you open?
We're open whenever the department is open (7am - midnight). However, committee members are usually there somewhere from 10am - 6pm (maybe even later during deadline weeks)

# Lab Access

## How do I join ICRS?
You just need to buy the membership [here](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/shop/csp/robotics/robotics-membership-24-25) and complete the induction in discord!

## I got the membership but I can't go into the lab with my card?
Make sure you completed the induction in discord by going to # general and typing /register <shortcode>

## What is a shortcode?/ I tried /register <shortcode> but it's throwing me an error?
Make sure your shortcode is correct, it is usually your initials and 3 letters (e.g. cl248)

## I got the membership, did the induction, but I still don't have access to the lab!
If you did everything above, then your code will have been shipped to the card office for them to give access. This happens every Thursday so you should get access within the week after Thursday (depending on card office's backlog). If it's been more than 2 weeks please ask a committee member about it

## I have access to the lab but the 3D priner scanner isn't reading my card?
Make sure you have also completed the 3D printer induction, and ask one of the committee to link your card (it runs on a separate database, sorry)

## My card should be linked and work on the 3D printer scanner but it's flashing red?
Try resetting the scanner by plugging and unplugging it. If it's still not working, as a committee member

# Projects
## I want to do a project in ICRS labs! What can I expect from them?
If you want to do a project and want your own storage? Ask @Jacob about it! Other than that if you need any advice or feedback on electronics and software, each committee member has their own specialty that they can answer. Of course, you're welcome to use the components and machines we provide.

## Can I do a project with ICRS? 
Historically, we've run small student-run projects but it has not been very successful due to having too many people but it being too advanced. Ask a committee member about it if you have an idea, especially @Martin who's in charge of projects this year.
